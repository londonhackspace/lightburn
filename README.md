Lightburn config and smoothieware configs for the laser cutter

* config.txt is the Smoothieware config. Lives on the root of the removable media mounted from the MBED.ORG MBED USB DISK USB Device
* prefs.ini is the Lightburn config. Lives in the C:\Users\Laser Cutter User\AppData\Local\LightBurn folder

## Todo:

* Clean and align optics
* Nail down configs, or at least make them easy to restore.
* Buy lightburn licence
* Prevent the MBED.ORG MBED USB DISK from automatically showing (requires Windows 10 Local Admin rights)
* Work out how to get the acnode logging laser run time reliably
* Differences documentation for existing lasercutter users
* Training for new lasercutter users
* Enjoy
